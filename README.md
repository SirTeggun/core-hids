# CORE-HIDS

## Overview

CORE-HIDS is an advanced research-oriented Host-Based Intrusion Detection framework designed to explore modern approaches to system-level security monitoring and behavioral anomaly detection.

The project focuses on constructing a flexible detection environment capable of analyzing host activity through a modular and extensible processing pipeline. Rather than implementing a rigid detection strategy, CORE-HIDS is architected as an experimental security platform where detection logic, profiling mechanisms, and response policies can evolve independently.

The system is developed in Python following a strict separation-of-concerns design philosophy, enabling long-term maintainability and supporting progressive enhancement of detection capabilities. The architecture is optimized for extensibility, allowing future integration of rule-based detection engines, statistical anomaly models, and severity-driven escalation workflows.

CORE-HIDS is intended to function both as a practical monitoring solution and as a security research framework for studying host-based threat detection methodologies, behavioral baseline modeling, and automated security response orchestration.

## Architecture

CORE-HIDS is built around a modular detection pipeline designed for future scalability.

### Detection Workflow

1. Event acquisition through `log_monitor`
2. Behavioral or rule-based analysis
3. Alert generation via `alerts` module
4. Logging and persistence handling
5. Asynchronous processing through worker threads or tasks

### Planned Evolution

The project roadmap includes:

- Refactoring detection logic into a `DetectionEngine` class
- Implementing modular rule objects for detection strategies
- Adding severity scoring and escalation management
- Building a robust persistence backend
- Optimizing real-time analysis performance
