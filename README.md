## 🧠 Architecture

The project follows a modular detection pipeline:

- Log monitoring and acquisition
- Baseline behavior analysis
- Rule-based detection logic
- Alert generation engine
- Worker execution layer
- Persistence storage interface

Planned evolution of the architecture includes:

- DetectionEngine abstraction
- Modular rule objects
- Severity and escalation engine
- Persistent threat event storage
