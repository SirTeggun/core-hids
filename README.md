# Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a modular Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) designed for research and defensive cybersecurity purposes.

The system is built with a rule-based detection engine, baseline behavior monitoring, alert generation, and persistence logging mechanisms.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This software is intended for educational and defensive security research only.

## 🧠 Architecture

The project follows a modular detection pipeline:

- Log monitoring and acquisition
- Baseline behavior analysis
- Rule-based detection logic
- Alert generation engine
- Worker execution layer
- Persistence storage interface

Planned evolution of the architecture includes:

- DetectionEngine abstraction
- Modular rule objects
- Severity and escalation engine
- Persistent threat event storage
